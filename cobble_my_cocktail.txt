Cobble My Cocktail

Build an app that allows a user to enter the odds and ends of their alcoholic beverages they have lying around, and return a tasty cocktail recipe for them!

Everyone has a collection of bottles of booze at the back of their cupboard, well this app will allow you to throw all of them into our system and get the recipe for a new and potentially hazardous drink!

MVP

* The app will allow the user to create and update a list of the drinks they have available to them
* The app will take the drinks available (and their quantities) and return a recipe which contains the appropriate ingredients 
* Theyâ€™ll be able to favourite recipes that the app suggests to them


Potential Extensions

* Include the ability for users to stipulate their likes and dislikes, so that only recipes they like will be offered.
* The app will display the strength of each drink - based on the ingredients - and restrict additional drinks being created
